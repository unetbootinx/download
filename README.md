UNetbootin (Universal Netboot Installer) is a program used to install a Linux/BSD distribution on computers without a CD/DVD drive using a USB stick. The installation medium can be a USB stick or directly a partition on the same computer.

UNetbootin is not only helpful for an installation, because with this application it is also possible to create a portable live distribution. If you install this distribution on a USB stick, for example, you can take your own distribution anywhere and always have a Linux installation at hand. UNetbootin is available in a Windows and a Linux version and supports a variety of distributions in addition to Ubuntu, e.g. Fedora, Gentoo, Damn Small Linux, etc. It is also possible to use an existing ISO image to install a brand new distribution that is not yet directly supported by UNetbootin. UNetbootin is also available for Windows.

This article describes the installation on a USB stick, which differs little from the installation on another partition.

### Create bootable USB sticks for Linux and BSD

UNetbootin supports various Linux distributions and BSD operating systems, which the tool can also download directly from the network. UNetbootin supports Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, Linux Mint, Zenwalk, CentOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Fedora, Gentoo, Puppy Linux and Arch Linux â€“ a complete list can be found on the manufacturer's website. Other distributions can also be added if required.

The preferred use of UNetbootin should not be downloading a Linux distribution with the freeware. Because UNetbootin shows only outdated distributions when selecting. Therefore, it is a good idea to download the current ISO file of the desired distribution yourself.

In UNetbootin you then select "Image" and over "..." the downloaded ISO file. If the Linux distribution is to be copied as an immutable live Linux or only for an installation on the USB stick instead of on a DVD, 0 MB can be left in the line "Space to get files between reboots". However, if you want to copy an Ubuntu distribution to a USB stick in order to use it as a working system on different computers, you should specify the remaining free space on the USB stick so that system changes and new files are not lost after a restart. Then select the drive type "USB drive" and the drive letter of the USB stick and click on "OK".

### Also installed on the hard drive

Instead of installing the Linux distribution on the USB stick, UNetbootin can set it up directly on the hard disk of the computer so that it can be started via the boot menu. In addition, the freeware supports various rescue and administration systems such as Parted Magic, SystemRescueCD, Dr.Web Antivirus, Kaspersky Rescue Disk, Backtrack or Ophcrack.

### UNetbootin is portable open source software

UNetbootin is available as open source software for Windows, Linux and macOS. The freeware can be used as portable software for Windows, but also requires administrator rights to run. In addition to German, there are other languages for UNetbootin that can be downloaded as language packs from the manufacturer's website.
